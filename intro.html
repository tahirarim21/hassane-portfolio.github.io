			<h3>What is <b>Tracert </b>?</h3>
			<center><img src="images/act1-img1.png" alt=""></center>
			<p>The Windows Tracert tool determines the route to a destination by sending ICMP packets to the destination.
				In these packets, Tracert uses varying IP <strong> Time-To-Live (TTL)</strong> values.
				The TTL is effectively a hop counter, where a hop is a location that the packet stops at, to reach the destination.
				The tool may take some time to complete (particularly if there is a problem), as the tool waits for responses (which may not come).
			You can see that my Machine have been able to finish 30 Hops for <strong> google.com</strong>

				<h3>What is <b>ipconfig</b>?</h3>
			<center><img src="images/act1-img2.png" alt=""></center>	
			<p>Displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
				and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. Used without parameters, ipconfig displays Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
				and IPv6 addresses, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters.</p>
				<h3>What is <b> IPconfig All </b>?</h3>
				<center><img src="images/act1-img3.png" alt=""></center>
				<p>	Displays the full TCP/IP configuration for all adapters. Adapters can represent physical interfaces, such as installed
					 network adapters, or logical interfaces, such as dial-up connections.</p>
			<h3>What is the Difference between IPconfig and IPconfig /all ?</h3>
			<p>Ipconfig shows IP address, Subnet Mask, and Default gateway for all adapters. Ipconfig /all shows the description of each network connection along with additional 
				information such as your physical (MAC) address, DHCP connections, Lease times, as well as in-depth IPv6 information.</p>

	<h3>Reflections:</h3>
	<p>
In this activity i have been able to learn about scanning tools as an IT student.I discussed the Tracert Tool in Windows and IPconfig . <br>
There's other scanning tools such as Nmap and Wireshark, There are a powerful tools used to gather information about the company and the network traffic.  </p>
