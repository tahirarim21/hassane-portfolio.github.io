			<br><br><h2>Digitalization </h2>
			<p>Firstly we need to know what is <b> Digitalisation </b> Digitization in cybersecurity refers to the process of incorporating digital technology into
                 an organization's cybersecurity practices. This involves the use of various digital tools and technologies to protect computer networks, devices, and 
                 sensitive data from cyber threats.Digitization in cybersecurity involves the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),
                  big data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance an organization's cybersecurity posture. These technologies can help organizations
                   to detect and respond to cyber threats quickly, automate security operations, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their cybersecurity practices.  </p>

			<h3>•What are the security implications of the digital economy? <br> <strong> According to Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) and then reflect your thoughts and responses to 
                the questions below</strong></h3>
           
			<p>The digital economy has brought great advances and benefits, such as increased efficiency, productivity, and accessibility. But this also creates new and complex cybersecurity 
                challenges that need to be addressed. Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) discuss the security implications of the digital economy and highlight the risks that 
                all-digital and brick-and-mortar SMEs face in transitioning to digital business. </p>
                <h3>•What is a <b>"fully digital enterprise" </b>?  </h3>
                <p>A fully digital company is one that has no physical presence, operates exclusively online, and conducts all its business activities digitally. These companies rely heavily 
                    on information technology and are vulnerable to various cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and data breaches. These attacks 
                    can have serious consequences, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability. 
                 </p>
                 <p>As information technology (IT) has reshaped the infrastructure and operations of enterprises, the digital enterprise evolved to represent businesses that have completed a digital transformation
                     or digitalization to embed digital solutions across the enterprise.</p>

                  <h3>•What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise? </h3>

                    <p>Fully digitized businesses face several cybersecurity challenges and concerns due to their dependence on digital technology and their online presence. The main challenges and concerns are:
						<p> <b>Data breach:</b> All-digital companies handle large amounts of sensitive data, including customer information, financial data, and intellectual property. Data breaches can cause significant financial 
							and reputational damage to businesses and expose them to legal liability.</p>
						<p> <b>Malware and viruses:</b> Malware and viruses can infect corporate systems and networks, compromise security, and disrupt business operations.</p>
						<p> <b>Phishing attack:</b>  A phishing attack is a fraudulent email or message that tricks an employee into divulging sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link, causing a data or system breach.</p>
						<p> <b>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks:</b>  DDoS attacks overload corporate systems and networks with traffic, making them unavailable to legitimate users.</p>
						<p><b>Insider Threat:</b> Insiders such as employees, contractors, and partners can intentionally or accidentally cause data and system breaches.</p>
					</p> 
            <h3>•What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</h3>
			<p> Brick-and-mortar SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) looking to do digital business face cybersecurity challenges such as:
				<p><b>Lack of cybersecurity expertise:</b> SMBs may not have the in-house expertise to design and implement robust cybersecurity measures. This can leave you vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
				<p><b>Insufficient budget for cybersecurity:</b> SMBs may have limited resources for cybersecurity. This can lead to inadequate cybersecurity measures and increased vulnerability to cyberthreats.</p>
				<p><b>Poor infrastructure:</b> Stationary small businesses may lack the hardware, software, and network infrastructure needed to securely support their digital operations. </p>
				<p><b>Employee Awareness:</b> Employees may not be aware of the cybersecurity risks associated with digital work. As a result, employees may engage in risky behavior that compromises the security of your organization.</p>
				<p><b>Risks in the supply chain:</b> Small businesses rely on third-party providers for a variety of services such as payment processing and logistics. If these third parties have weak security practices, they can pose a cybersecurity risk to your organization.</p>

			<h3>•Reflections:</h3><p>There are several advantages to the digital economy, including improved accessibility and efficiency. But it has also brought forth challenging cybersecurity issues. The articles mentioned emphasize the dangers brick and mortar and fully digital SMEs confront while implementing digital business methods.

				A totally digital business depends largely on information technology and runs entirely online. They are vulnerable to a range of cyber risks because of their reliance on digital infrastructure, including malware, phishing attacks, denial of service (DoS) assaults, and data breaches. These dangers may lead to monetary loss, harm to one's reputation, and legal culpability.</p>
